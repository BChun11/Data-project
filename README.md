# Data-project

This repository contains a collection of my data projects, including data analysis, and big-data processing projects. 

## Project List
- atm_analysis.ipynb: Data analysis project of an ATM dataset that includes EDA and OLS, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net and Neural Network models.
- project1.py: MapReduce project - Performed data analytics over a dataset of online social networks using MRJob. 
Project 2 includes 2 files:  Perform text data analysis over a dataset of Australian news from ABC using both RDD and DataFrame APIs of Spark with Python. 
- project2_df.py: This is a Spark DataFrame project that processes text data to compute Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weights for each term in a given dataset. The input dataset contains dates and terms, and the code processes the data to compute the TF-IDF weights of each term per year. The top 'k' terms with the highest TF-IDF weights for each year are selected and saved to an output file.
- project2_rdd.py: RDD version of project 2
- project3.py: Similarity Join using PySpark
